# Daily Cluster Health Check

Check our cluster's overall health. Look for any unhealthy nodes, problematic pods, and resource pressures. Pay special attention to pods with high restart counts and deployments that aren't meeting their replica counts. Create a visual health summary and highlight any critical issues that need immediate attention.

Share findings in #devops-oncall, with clear priorities for any needed actions.
