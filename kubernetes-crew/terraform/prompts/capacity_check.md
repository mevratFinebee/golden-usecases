# Kubernetes Capacity Planning Analysis

Perform a comprehensive capacity analysis:

1. Current Resource Usage:
   - Analyze cluster-wide CPU and memory usage trends
   - Review storage utilization across all PVs
   - Check network bandwidth consumption
   - Monitor node capacity limits

2. Growth Patterns:
   - Analyze historical resource usage trends
   - Identify peak usage patterns
   - Calculate growth rates per namespace
   - Project future resource needs

3. Optimization Opportunities:
   - Identify underutilized resources
   - Review resource request vs actual usage
   - Check for oversized deployments
   - Analyze scaling patterns

4. Recommendations:
   - Suggest cluster scaling needs
   - Recommend resource quota adjustments
   - Propose optimization strategies
   - Outline capacity expansion timeline

5. Report Generation:
   - Create capacity planning report
   - Include growth projections
   - List recommended actions
   - Highlight critical capacity concerns
