Analyze cluster resource usage and efficiency. Identify the top resource consumers, any resource pressure points, and opportunities for optimization. Create a diagram showing resource distribution across namespaces and highlight any areas approaching critical thresholds.

Provide specific scaling recommendations and share the analysis in #devops-oncall.
