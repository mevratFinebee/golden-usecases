## 💬 Example Interactions

### Pipeline Diagnosis
```plaintext
You: @github-crew what's wrong with the latest workflow?

Crew: I'll investigate the failure.
Analyzing GitHub Actions logs:
✓ Workflow: CI.yml
✓ Failed Step: npm test
✓ Error logs retrieved

Found issue:
- Test suite timeout in auth-service
- Last successful run: 2 hours ago
- Changed files: auth middleware

Would you like me to:
1. Show detailed error logs
2. Create a JIRA ticket
3. Guide you through debugging steps
```

### Error Analysis
```plaintext
You: @github-crew analyze test failures in main

Crew: 🔍 Analyzing GitHub Actions test results...

Failed workflow: test-suite.yml
Failed job: integration-tests
Step: npm run test:integration

Key findings:
1. API Tests ❌
   - Timeout in authentication flow
2. Database Tests ❌
   - Connection refused
3. Cache Tests ✅

Recommended actions:
1. Review auth service logs
2. Check database connectivity
3. Create JIRA ticket for tracking
```
